# Week 4 Assignment

Materials for AIAP 2.0 #Week 4 of Intro to Neural Network

# Part 1 Description

In this part, you will practice putting together a simple image classification pipeline, based on the different type of classifiers. The goals of this part of assignment are as follows:

- understand the basic **Image Classification pipeline** and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)
- understand the train/val/test **splits** and the use of validation data for **hyperparameter tuning**.
- develop proficiency in writing efficient **vectorized** code with numpy
- implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (**kNN**) classifier
- implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (**SVM**) classifier
- implement and apply a **Softmax** classifier
- implement and apply a **Two layer neural network** classifier
- understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers
- get a basic understanding of performance improvements from using **higher-level representations** than raw pixels (e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Gradient (HOG) features)

# Part 2 Description
In this part, you will practice writing backpropagation code, and training Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. The goals of this part of assignment are as follows:

- understand **Neural Networks** and how they are arranged in layered architectures
- understand and be able to implement (vectorized) **backpropagation**
- implement various **update rules** used to optimize Neural Networks
- implement **batch normalization** for training deep networks
- implement **dropout** to regularize networks
- effectively **cross-validate** and find the best hyperparameters for Neural Network architecture
- understand the architecture of **Convolutional Neural Networks** and train gain experience with training these models on data
