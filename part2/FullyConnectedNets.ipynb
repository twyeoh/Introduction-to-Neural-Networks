    "# Q1: Fully-Connected Neural Nets (FCNN)\n",
    "In the previous part, you implemented a fully-connected two-layer neural network on CIFAR-10. The implementation was simple but not very modular since the loss and gradient were computed in a single monolithic function. This is manageable for a simple two-layer network, but would become impractical as you move to bigger models. Ideally, you want to build networks using a more modular design so that you can implement different layer types in isolation and then snap them together into models with different architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In part of exercise, you will implement fully-connected networks using a more modular approach. For each layer, you need to implement a `forward` and a `backward` function. The `forward` function will receive inputs, weights, and other parameters and will return both an output and a `cache` object storing data needed for the backward pass, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def layer_forward(x, w):\n",
    "  \"\"\" Receive inputs x and weights w \"\"\"\n",
    "  # Do some computations ...\n",
    "  z = # ... some intermediate value\n",
    "  # Do some more computations ...\n",
    "  out = # the output\n",
    "   \n",
    "  cache = (x, w, z, out) # Values we need to compute gradients\n",
    "   \n",
    "  return out, cache\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The backward pass will receive upstream derivatives and the `cache` object, and will return gradients with respect to the inputs and weights, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def layer_backward(dout, cache):\n",
    "  \"\"\"\n",
    "  Receive derivative of loss with respect to outputs and cache,\n",
    "  and compute derivative with respect to inputs.\n",
    "  \"\"\"\n",
    "  # Unpack cache values\n",
    "  x, w, z, out = cache\n",
    "  \n",
    "  # Use values in cache to compute derivatives\n",
    "  dx = # Derivative of loss with respect to x\n",
    "  dw = # Derivative of loss with respect to w\n",
    "  \n",
    "  return dx, dw\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After implementing a bunch of layers this way, you will be able to easily combine them to build classifiers with different architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to implementing fully-connected networks of arbitrary depth, you will also explore different update rules for optimization, and introduce Dropout as a regularizer and Batch Normalization as a tool to more efficiently optimize deep networks.\n",
